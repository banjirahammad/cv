<p>Facebook's industry leading javascript library, react js, is no doubt a game changer in the world of front-end development. A ground breaking awesome product, track blazer that shipped with myriads of innovation; think JSX, component based approach, virtual DOM, mobile app development with react native, to name a few.</p>

<p>The simplicity, performance improvements and developer goodies brought by react were so ground breaking that it made its predecessors a story of the past, that developers are happy to forget.<br>
The likes of Backbone.js, Knockout.js, Ember.js are now old stories, developer are willing to tell.</p>

<p>And Angular Js, react's single, biggest competitor, backed by IT giants google, was forced to do a complete rewrite, adopting reacts components based approach and mirroring several other best innovations from react, in other to stay relevant.<br>
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8507833">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8507833</a></p>

<p>But despite all these react.js is still taking other the world: <br>
<a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ys8xRGKG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ogey90hpet6q3ueqqppo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ys8xRGKG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ogey90hpet6q3ueqqppo.png" loading="lazy"></a></p>

<p>However, with all of this react goodness; as it is with everything created by man, react has a glitch. No! Not in the library itself, but yes! In its licensing. This seems to be a major object of concern that may sometimes force developers, startup and companies to think twice before adopting the library into their technology stack.<br>
This is so because Facebook chose to use a BSD-derived license that contained some <a href="https://thenextweb.com/dd/2017/09/19/should-developers-be-afraid-of-zuckerbergs-bearing-gifts/">troubling litigation issue</a>.</p>

<p>I'm not a legal practitioner but if you where to consider the number of <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191">github issues raised on facebook's react.js licensing</a> and do some reading on <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/112130496157735/explaining-react-s-license/">the react licensing</a>, added with the the number of developer backlash on this issue already, I don't know about you bro, but my eyebrows are raised!</p>

<p>A good read on this issue: <a href="https://hackernoon.com/facebooks-bsd-patents-license-and-how-it-affects-you-66088e052845">https://hackernoon.com/facebooks-bsd-patents-license-and-how-it-affects-you-66088e052845</a></p>

<p>Following the licensing one would have to double check to know if he is about to shoot himself in the foot or not, because react.js was looking, something like a diamond with a rotten core. Well that would be, if you manage to run into the licensing issue. But why the unnecessary risk?</p>

<p>Regardless of all the pressures, Facebook however has refused to change the BSD+Patents open source license used on react.js. Not even when a company in the caliber of apache, announced that Facebook's BSD+Patents open source license has been disallowed for inclusion with Apache products. <br>
Facebook appeared nothing dauntless.</p>

<p>It is therefore a shockingly, happy moment when you read that Facebook has now agreed to re-license not only react.js but several other of its open source products.  viz: Jest, Flow, and Immutable.js<br>
<a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/300798627056246/relicensing-react-jest-flow-and-immutable-js/">https://code.facebook.com/posts/300798627056246/relicensing-react-jest-flow-and-immutable-js/</a></p>

<p>Wow! What could have moved this mountain?</p>

<p>I think of no other reason but the announcement of wordpress dropping react; not only on Gutenberg (their new project) but also on calypso (wordpress.com). <br>
Curling from mat mullenweg's blog: <a href="https://ma.tt/">https://ma.tt/</a></p>

<p>"I am surprised and excited to see the news that Facebook is going to drop the patent clause that I wrote about last week. They’ve announced that with React 16 the license will just be regular MIT with no patent addition."</p>

<p>And more after considering react's licensing:</p>

<blockquote>"I'm here to say that the Gutenberg team is going to take a step back and rewrite Gutenberg using a different library. It will likely delay Gutenberg at least a few weeks, and may push the release into next year.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Automattic will also use whatever we choose for Gutenberg to rewrite Calypso – that will take a lot longer, and Automattic still has no issue with the patents clause, but the long-term consistency with core is worth more than a short-term hit to Automattic’s business from a rewrite. Core WordPress updates go out to over a quarter of all websites, having them all inherit the patents clause isn’t something I’m comfortable with."</blockquote>

<p>For Facebook, wordpress adopting react.js for the wordpress.com dashboard named calypso is a big coup for react.js. Considering wordpress owns about 28% of the web right now, and the viral talk of wordpress adopting React js &amp; Node.js fully; after successfully using in developing calypso, was beginning to become popular among JS developers, who would rather use twig to avoid writing that ugly PHP syntax, when developing with wordpress.</p>

<p>A collapse of the romance between these two PHP giants would have been too much for Facebook to handle. The loss of 27% of the web and the possibility of many other companies following suite, with Vue.js now playing catch-up, I don't care about Facebook's reason of changing the licensing, we found it here :-). </p>

<p>Although Facebook's reason for changing the license was given by their engineering director Adam Wolff, quoting him:</p>

<blockquote>“React is the foundation of a broad ecosystem of open source software for the web, and we don’t want to hold back forward progress for nontechnical reasons.”</blockquote>

<p>I don't know about you, but as a developer who believes wordpress and not Facebook saved PHP, I certainly believe, wordpress, dropping react in all their projects was instrumental in Facebook changing their licensing. <br>
Not suggesting wordpress alone, but every single backlash and pressure, down to the wordpress moment of course was instrumental. However, I believe the wordpress blow just pushes the pressure past the threshold level. And of course the irrevocable has been revoked.</p>

<p>Congratulations Facebook, Thank you wordpress, apache and all other developers who spoke out. </p>

<p>Wow! Now we can use our favourite front-end development tool without an iota of worry in our hearts...</p>

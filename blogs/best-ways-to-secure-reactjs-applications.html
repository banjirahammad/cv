                          </h3>

                          <ul>
                          <li><p>Using react.js you can create simple yet attractive web applications. The apps would run flawlessly and thus users can use the features free from any worries.</p></li>
                          <li><p>React.js can be easily used along with other JS libraries and thus you can implement the advanced form of technology.</p></li>
                          <li><p>React.js helps you to develop customized web applications. You can incorporate the open-source components and thus it brings in the positive features.</p></li>
                          </ul>

                          <p>So, you get a clear idea of why to use React.js to develop tailor-made web applications.</p>

                          <h2>
                          <a name="how-to-secure-your-reactjs-application" href="#how-to-secure-your-reactjs-application">
                          </a>
                          How to secure your React.js application?
                          </h2>

                          <p>Presently, React.js has become a popular platform to develop web applications. It's important to know how to secure the React.js web applications and thus you can start developing the app free from any worries. The ways to secure React.js apps are:</p>

                          <ul>
                          <li><p>First, you need to secure React's HTTP basic authentication. It's one of the most important things to check while building an application using react.js. This feature is used to connect user ids and passwords. You need to take care of the realm attribute while securing the application. It authenticates different users with multiple code variables and it helps in handling the whole authentication process.</p></li>
                          <li><p>Now, you need to secure the React applications against DDoS attacks. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) makes the app unavailable to users. And thus you need to provide security against DDoS attacks. It's good to examine all kinds of DDoS attacks, which may happen during or after the development. You can also use CAPTCHAs and JS tests to secure the React applications. Next, you must check visitors' identity ensuring that no attackers are entering your site.</p></li>
                          <li><p>You may also face XSS attacks during the development procedure and you need to know how to secure your React application from XSS attacks. Now, the injection attacks can be easily identified through different APIs and thus you can take the necessary measures to avoid such attacks.</p></li>
                          <li><p>Next, you can disable the HTML markups. When you set a disabled attribute for an HTML element it becomes non-mutable. Hence, you can avoid any bad data from attacking the application. In this way, you can protect your application from any disastrous effects.</p></li>
                          <li><p>Using JavaScript XML is another way to secure the applications. It's a syntax and you can get familiar with the auto-escaping functionality that helps you to secure the React applications. You need to bind the data with braces {} and the auto-escaping functionality would be automatically activated.</p></li>
                          <li><p>It's important to handle the allowlist/blocklist in the right way. Allowlist would contain all the links, which are considered safe for your React application. And the blocklist would contain all the links, which are considered threats to your application. These links would be automatically blocked if there is an access request.</p></li>
                          <li><p>The React APIs allow connections between the application and other services. So, it stores important data and thus the app gets exposed to certain malicious attacks. You can use a mitigation technique that would protect your application from all susceptible attacks.</p></li>
                          <li><p>You can implement a web application Firewall and it blocks any bad content damaging the app's functionality. It filters the web traffic and thus your app would keep on functioning free from any interruption.</p></li>
                          </ul>

                          <p>Taken as a whole, you get a clear idea of how to protect your React application from dangerous attacks. Thus, you can comprehend the true importance of modern technology and it brings in the benefits in real-time. So, users can use the apps freely and you can help users to make use of the advanced features. In this way, you can comprehend how the React.js apps come up with advanced options.</p>

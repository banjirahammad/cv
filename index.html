                                </h3>
                                <p>
                                  As we all know, with React, it’s possible to
                                  have huge components that execute a number of
                                  tasks. But a better way to design components
                                  is to keep them small, so that one component
                                  corresponds to one function. Ideally, a single
                                  component should render a specific bit of your
                                  page or modify a particular behavior. There
                                  are many advantages to this:
                                </p>

                                    • Function-specific components can be
                                    standalone, which makes testing and
                                    maintenance easier.

                                    • Each small component can be reused across
                                    multiple projects.
                                  </li>
                                  <li>
                                    • Components executing general functions can
                                    be made available to the community.

                                    implement performance optimization.
                                  </li>

                                  The balance between creating one concise
                                  component and creating multiple
                                  function-specific components can vary from
                                  organization to organization. After all, you
                                  can have as many components as you want, and
                                  recombine them in any way you want to achieve
                                  the same end result.

                                  By sticking to the rule of one function = one
                                  component, you can improve the reusability of
                                  components. What this means is that you should
                                  skip trying to build a new component for a
                                  function if there already exists a component
                                  for that function.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  By reusing components across your project or
                                  across any number of projects, not only will
                                  you achieve consistency, you’ll also be
                                  contributing to the community.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  On the other hand, if any component becomes
                                  huge, unwieldy and difficult to maintain, it’s
                                  better to break it up into as many smaller
                                  components as required.
                                </p>

                                  For example, you can even go further and
                                  create a Button component that can handle
                                  icons. Then, each time you need a button,
                                  you’ll have a component to use. Making it more
                                  modular will allow you to cover many cases
                                  with the same piece of code. You have to aim
                                  somewhere in the middle. Your components
                                  should be abstract enough, but shouldn’t be
                                  overly complex.

                                </h3>
                                <p>
                                  A common rule for all code is to keep it as
                                  brief and concise as possible.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  It’s no different here too, since React best
                                  practices also instruct you to keep code brief
                                  and precise. One way to do this is to avoid
                                  duplication – Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  You can achieve this by scrutinizing the code
                                  for patterns and similarities. If you find
                                  any, it’s possible you’re repeating code and
                                  there’s scope to eliminate duplication. Most
                                  likely, a bit of rewriting can make it more
                                  concise.
                                </p>

                                  This relies heavily on the reusability
                                  principle in React. Let’s say you want to add
                                  multiple buttons that contain icons, instead
                                  of adding the markup for each button, you can
                                  simply use the IconButton component that we
                                  shown above. You could even go further by
                                  mapping everything into an array.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  When you start working on a project, it is a
                                  common practice to keep all the CSS styles in
                                  a single SCSS file. The use of a global prefix
                                  prevents any potential name collisions.
                                  However, when your project scales up, this
                                  solution may not be feasible.

                                  files for your production. First, install
                                  EmotionJS using npm.

                                  6. Name the component after the function
                                </h3>
                                <p>
                                  It’s a good idea to name a component after the
                                  function that it executes so that it’s easily
                                  recognizable.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  For example, ProductTable – it conveys
                                  instantly what the component does. On the
                                  other hand, if you name the component based on
                                  the need for the code, it can confuse you at a
                                  future point of time.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  Another example, it’s preferable to name a
                                  component Avatar so that it can be used
                                  anywhere – for authors, users or in comments.
                                  Instead, if we name the component AuthorAvatar
                                  in the context of its usage, we’d be limiting
                                  the utility of that component.

                                  Besides, naming a component after the function
                                  makes it more useful to the community as it’s
                                  more likely to be discovered.

                                  If, like most folks, you’re using JSX (a
                                  JavaScript extension), the names of the
                                  components you create need to begin with
                                  uppercase letters. For instance, you’ll name
                                  components as SelectButton instead of
                                  selectbutton, or Menu instead of menu. We do
                                  this so that JSX can identify them differently
                                  from default HTML tags.
                                </p>

                                  Earlier React versions maintained a list of
                                  all built-in names to differentiate them from
                                  custom names. But as the list needed constant
                                  updating, that was scrapped and capitals
                                  became the norm.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  In case JSX is not your language of choice,
                                  you can use lowercase letters. However, this
                                  may reduce the reusability of components
                                  beyond your project.

                                <p>
                                  When working with React, you are generally
                                  using JSX (JavaScript Extension) files. Any
                                  component that you create for React should
                                  therefore be named in Pascal case, or upper
                                  camel case. This translates to names without
                                  spaces and the capitalizing the first letter
                                  of every word.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  If you want to create a function that submits
                                  a form, you should name it SubmitForm in upper
                                  camel case, rather than submitForm,
                                  submit_form, or submit_form. Upper camel case
                                  is more commonly called Pascal case. Here is a

                                  can be stateful or stateless. Stateful
                                  components store information about the
                                  component’s state and provide the necessary
                                  context. In contrast, stateless components
                                  have no memory and cannot give context to
                                  other parts of the UI. They only receive props
                                  (inputs) from parent component and return you
                                  JSX elements. They are scalable and reusable,
                                  and similar to pure function in JavaScript.
                                </p>

                                  One of React best practices is to keep your
                                  stateful data-loading logic separate from your
                                  rendering stateless logic. It’s better to have
                                  one stateful component to load data and
                                  another stateless component to display that
                                  data. This reduces the complexity of the
                                  components.

                                  The later React versions v16.8 have a new
                                  feature – React Hooks, which write stateful
                                  function-related components. This may
                                  eventually eliminate the need for class-based
                                  components.

                                  want.

                                  For instance, for the Form component, all
                                  pieces such as CSS files, icons, images, tests
                                  and any other sub-components relating to Form
                                  should all reside in the same folder. If you
                                  name files sensibly, and keep related files
                                  together logically, you’ll not have any
                                  difficulty finding them later.

                                <p>
                                  One of React best practices that helps to
                                  organize all your React components is the use
                                  of tools like
                                  <a
                                    href="https://bit.dev/"
                                    style="color: aliceblue"
                                    >Bit</a
                                  >.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  These tools help to maintain and reuse code.
                                  Beyond that, it helps code to become
                                  discoverable, and promotes team collaboration
                                  in building components. Also, code can be
                                  synced across projects.
                                </p>
                              </li>

                                <h3>13. Use snippet libraries</h3>
                                <p>
                                  Code snippets help you to keep up with the
                                  best and most recent syntax. They also help to
                                  keep your code relatively bug free, so this is
                                  one of the React best practices that you
                                  should not miss out on.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  There are many snippet libraries that you can
                                  use, like, ES7 React, Redux, JS Snippets, etc.
                                </p>
                              </li>

                                <h3>14. Write tests for all code</h3>
                                <p>
                                  In any programming language, adequate testing
                                  ensures that any new code added to your
                                  project integrates well with existing code and
                                  does not break existing functionality. It is a
                                  good idea to write tests for any new component
                                  that you create. As a good practice, you
                                  should create a __Test__ directory within your
                                  component’s directory to house all relevant
                                  tests.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  You can broadly divide tests in React into two
                                  parts: testing the functionality of components
                                  using a React app, and tests on your complete
                                  application once it renders in the browser.
                                  You can use
                                  <a
                                    href="https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/best-cross-browser-testing-tools/"

                                  >
                                  tools for tests in the latter category.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  For the former, you can use a JavaScript test
                                  runner, Jest to emulate the HTML DOM using
                                  jsdom to test React components. While a
                                  completely accurate test is only possible in a
                                  browser on a real device,
                                  <a
                                    href="https://jestjs.io/"
                                    style="color: aliceblue"

                                  >
                                  provides a good approximation of the real
                                  testing environment during the development
                                  phase of your project.

                                  Linting is a process wherein we run a program
                                  that analyses code for potential errors.

                                  Mostly, we use it for language-related issues.
                                  But it can also fix many other issues
                                  automatically, particularly code style. Using
                                  a linter in your React code helps to keep your
                                  code relatively error- and bug-free.
                                </p>

                                  companies ask in their interviews. It becomes
                                  clear very quickly when an applicant knows
                                  just enough to have scraped by, but doesn’t
                                  have a solid understanding the language.

                                  The .all method on the Promise object is a
                                  neat way to process a list of asynchronous
                                  actions in order and receive an Array of
                                  results. e.g.
                                </p>

                                <br />
                                <p>
                                  Above we have a fake urlArray variable. Assume
                                  that this is actual urls that we want to
                                  fetch. Since fetching is an async event we
                                  simulate that with the function asyncAction.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  All asyncAction actually does is return a
                                  promise which resolves at a random interval
                                  between 0 and 5000ms. This is to simulate
                                  changes in network latency, not all requests
                                  respond in the exact same time.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  To create an Array of Promises, we map the
                                  urlArray and return a new Array with the
                                  Promises after calling asyncAction. These
                                  aren't resolved yet, so we use Promise.all()
                                  in start() to give us an Array of results and
                                  since the function just returns the number:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  console.log("Results: ", results); // Results:
                                  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]

                                <p>
                                  The results demonstrate that even though each
                                  request took a considerable different amount
                                  of time to complete, the Promise.all() method
                                  made sure that the results were returned in
                                  the correct order, hooray there's reliability!
                                  Or is there...

                                  to this:

                                    process multiple URLs in an Array
                                    asynchronously and give it a timestamp that
                                    was congruent to the order of the Array.
                                    Sounds like the perfect job for
                                    Promise.all().

                                    resolutions, there was this effect that
                                    timestamps were dependent on these random

                                  Promise.all() is a super handy tool but
                                  because of it's abstraction, it's easy to
                                  overlook something like a time component. Keep
                                  in mind, the first example ran much quicker
                                  than the second, since the timers didn't need
                                  to complete before the next result was fired.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  So in general, if there is an element of time.
                                  e.g. a dateCreated property on the results of
                                  a list of Promises or asynchronous actions,
                                  consider using a loop instead of
                                  Promise.all().
